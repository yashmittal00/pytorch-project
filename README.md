Rendering the semantic content of an image in different styles .Transferring the style from one image onto another can be considered a problem of texture transfer. In texture transfer the goal is to synthesise a texture from a source image while constraining the texture synthesis in order to preserve the semantic content of a target image. For texture synthesis there exist a large range of powerful non-parametric algorithms that can synthesise photorealistic natural textures by resampling the pixels of a given source texture [7, 30, 8, 20].
To do so,
please install pip3 ,numpy,matplotlib.
